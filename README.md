# Bonux Points
This program is written generally to allow a more flexible input. Included is an alternative data set `data2.csv` which has data from the tutorial. Although the fields and number of attributes are different, the program can handle that.

# Prerequisite
Python 2.7 with the following packges:
```
 - numpy
 - pprint
 - csv  (included in std lib)
 - math (included in std lib)
 - copy (included in std lib)
```

If any of the above is missing, use
`pip install [packagename]`
